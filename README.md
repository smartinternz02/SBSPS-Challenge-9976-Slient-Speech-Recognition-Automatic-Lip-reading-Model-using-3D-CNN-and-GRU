Slient Speech Recognition : Automatic Lip reading Model using 3D CNN and GRU
# Overview
The Silent Speech Recognition project aims to develop an advanced model for automatic lip reading using a combination of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). Traditional speech recognition heavily relies on audio input, but this project focuses on extracting information solely from lip movements, enabling speech recognition in scenarios with no audible speech or in noisy environments.

# Motivation
Traditional speech recognition systems face challenges in noisy environments and situations where audible speech is not possible. Silent speech recognition, which relies on visual cues like lip movements, has the potential to address these challenges. This project aims to build an accurate and robust silent speech recognition system using deep learning techniques.

# Features
Utilizes 3D CNN to extract spatial features from lip images.
Uses GRU for sequence modeling and capturing temporal patterns.
End-to-end deep learning pipeline for silent speech recognition.
Easy-to-use interface for training and evaluation.
